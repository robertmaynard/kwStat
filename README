kwStat a cross platform stat function and structure.

The goal is to provide a simple wrapper to to stat on 32bit and 64bit machines
that properly handle large address support and the different signatures of the
stat function.

The primary goal is to always provide the largest aviable stat function.
So on Large Address 32bit builds we only plan on providing the 64bit stat function.
Currently we are focused on getting file validity and file size functions correct.
The second stage is to generalize the time aspect

Usage of kw::stat :

  #include "kwStat.h"
  #include <iostream>
  #include <assert.h>

  int main(int argc, char **argv)
  {
    kw::stat s("test.txt");
	assert(s.fileExists()==true);
    return 0;
  }

Usage of file_length:

  #include "kwStat.h"
  #include <iostream>

  int main(int argc, char **argv)
  {
    kw::stat s("test.txt");
    std::cout << s.fileLength() << std::endl;
	return 0;
  }
